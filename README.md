# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Implementation of SVM model for classification of Breast Cancer

The above project classifies breast cancer as malignant and benign using SVM (support vector machines),with given features(e.g radius, area , smoothness etc) implemented using scikit-learn
THe dataset is taken from sklearn datasets (csv file)
Model are imporved by normalization and by tuning c and gamma parameters
The model gives and test accuracy of 95%
